## Android Notes clone in react

This appliation is a sort of clone of the android notes app on my phone. I was just using this as a way to play around with react state and props since im still new to the framework. I picked the clone route so i dont have to worry much about the visual design of the site since the android notes is pretty simple in design.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
